- ## Question:
>There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] >indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
>
>For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
>Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, >return an empty array.

- Example :

      Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
      Output: [0,1]
      Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
