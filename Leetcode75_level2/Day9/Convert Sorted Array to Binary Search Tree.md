# Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
- ## Question:
>Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.
>
>A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

- Example :

      Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
      Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
      Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9]
