# Path Sum III
- ## Question:
>Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals targetSum.
>
>The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

- Example :

      Input: root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8
      Output: 3
      Explanation: The paths that sum to 8 are shown.
