# 3Sum Closest
- ## Question:
>Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
>
>Return the sum of the three integers.
>
>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.



- Example :

      Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
      Output: 2
      Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
