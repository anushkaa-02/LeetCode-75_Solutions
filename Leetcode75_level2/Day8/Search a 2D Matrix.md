# Search a 2D Matrix
- ## Question:
>Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
>
- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

- Example :

      Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
      Output: true
